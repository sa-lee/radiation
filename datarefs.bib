  abstract = "Variations in sample quality are frequently encountered in small
              RNA-sequencing experiments, and pose a major challenge in a
              differential expression analysis. Removal of high variation
              samples reduces noise, but at a cost of reducing power, thus
              limiting our ability to detect biologically meaningful changes.
              Similarly, retaining these samples in the analysis may not reveal
              any statistically significant changes due to the higher noise
              level. A compromise is to use all available data, but to
              down-weight the observations from more variable samples. We
              describe a statistical approach that facilitates this by
              modelling heterogeneity at both the sample and observational
              levels as part of the differential expression analysis. At the
              sample level this is achieved by fitting a log-linear variance
              model that includes common sample-specific or group-specific
              parameters that are shared between genes. The estimated sample
              variance factors are then converted to weights and combined with
              observational level weights obtained from the mean-variance
              relationship of the log-counts-per-million using 'voom'. A
              comprehensive analysis involving both simulations and
              experimental RNA-sequencing data demonstrates that this strategy
              leads to a universally more powerful analysis and fewer false
              discoveries when compared to conventional approaches. This
              methodology has wide application and is implemented in the
              open-source 'limma' package.",

              the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts, generates a

  author   = "Liao, Yang and Smyth, Gordon K and Shi, Wei",
  abstract = "Read alignment is an ongoing challenge for the analysis of data
              from sequencing technologies. This article proposes an elegantly
              simple multi-seed strategy, called seed-and-vote, for mapping
              reads to a reference genome. The new strategy chooses the mapped
              genomic location for the read directly from the seeds. It uses a
              relatively large number of short seeds (called subreads)
              extracted from each read and allows all the seeds to vote on the
              optimal location. When the read length is <160 bp, overlapping
              subreads are used. More conventional alignment algorithms are
              then used to fill in detailed mismatch and indel information
              between the subreads that make up the winning voting block. The
              strategy is fast because the overall genomic location has already
              been chosen before the detailed alignment is done. It is
              sensitive because no individual subread is required to map
              exactly, nor are individual subreads constrained to map close by
              other subreads. It is accurate because the final location must be
              supported by several different subreads. The strategy extends
              easily to find exon junctions, by locating reads that contain
              sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same gene. It
              scales up efficiently for longer reads.",

              sequence reads to genomic features",
  author   = "Liao, Yang and Smyth, Gordon K and Shi, Wei",
  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Next-generation sequencing technologies generate
              millions of short sequence reads, which are usually aligned to a
              reference genome. In many applications, the key information
              required for downstream analysis is the number of reads mapping
              to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene.
              The process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read
              summarization is required for a great variety of genomic analyses
              but has so far received relatively little attention in the
              literature. RESULTS: We present featureCounts, a read
              summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from
              either RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts
              implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature
              blocking techniques. It is considerably faster than existing
              methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization)
              and requires far less computer memory. It works with either
              single or paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options
              appropriate for different sequencing applications. AVAILABILITY
              AND IMPLEMENTATION: featureCounts is available under GNU General
